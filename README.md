# ProspectalQ-AI-Mineral-Exploration
 🌍 **An AI-Driven Exploration for Critical Minerals in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh**
 
 ---

Our project utilizes **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to explore 39,000 square kilometers of mineral-rich terrain in **Karnataka** and **Andhra Pradesh**. Targeting deep-seated mineralized bodies, we focus on critical minerals like **Rare Earth Elements (REE)**, **Ni-PGE**, **copper**, and more, through advanced **depth modeling techniques**. ⛏️✨

## 📊 **AI-Powered Predictive Mapping**
We integrate **geological**, **geochemical**, and **geophysical** data, processed with AI algorithms to generate high-precision **mineral predictive maps**. These maps, visualized in **2D** using **Kepler.gl**, allow for interactive exploration of high-potential areas. 🌐🗺️

### 🔮 **Future Vision: 3D Exploration**
As we move forward, we plan to enhance our models by taking them to the next level with **3D visualizations**. This will provide even deeper insights into mineral exploration. 📈💎

## 🔍 **Interpretability with SHAP**
To ensure **transparency** and **trust**, we use **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)**, which explains how each data feature influences mineral predictions. This empowers exploration teams to make **data-driven decisions**. 🤖📊

## 🎓 **Student-Led, Future-Oriented**
As students balancing **semester exams**, we focused on delivering **2D maps**. However, if time permits, our future goal is to not only predict **mineral-rich zones** but also identify the exact **mineral types** present. We are ready to take this project to the next level with **3D predictive maps**! 🎓🔜🌟
